# EJPRD-2020 & Genome-analysis-and-variant-discovery

In this hands-on practice we will introduce the Linux/Bash environment and basic commands including listing, copying and moving the files. Next, we will present the file formats that are used to store the raw and intermediate Next Generation Sequencing files as well as genomic variant data. We will demonstrate how to analyze the raw genome sequence data including the quality control, mapping to the reference genome and genomic variant discovery steps.
